# Welcome to Plant Puller

This is a demo program for showing how to use agent in real life. In this application users can ask information about plant care. As they ask the agent will look and see if it has any information related to the care of that plant in a local OpenSearch index. If it doesn't have the infomrmation it will then seek to find the information online using a few-shot prompt.
